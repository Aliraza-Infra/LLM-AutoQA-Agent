# LLM-AutoQA-Agent

LLM-AutoQA-Agent is a modular Python framework for automated quality assurance of LLM-generated outputs. It provides structured evaluation pipelines for hallucination detection, tone/relevance assessment, and scoring, with optional integration for Google Sheets task queues.

Built using FastAPI and pandas, the project is designed to be extensible, lightweight, and suitable for research, internal tools, or production workflows.
